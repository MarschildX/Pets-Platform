# Pets-Platform
`Java` &nbsp; `Android`

This project is a platform about pet info and consists of Java Server and Android client. To be honest, it is more like a attempt and demo because it's my first Android large assignment in Internet Programming Course. The whole project is supported by my crude ideas. But I still share it here for it's my small achievement and I regard it as my first further explore in Android. Though it is simple and naive, it can communicate between server and client. And I have designed and implement a UI which looks okay for it.
