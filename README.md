# Pets-Platform
`Java` &nbsp; `Android`

This project is a platform about pet info and consists of Java Server and Android client. To be honest, it is more like a attempt and demo because it's my first Android large assignment in Internet Programming Course. The whole project is supported by my crude ideas. But I still share it here for it's my small achievement and I regard it as my first further explore in Android. Though it is simple and naive, it can communicate between server and client. And I have designed and implement a UI which looks okay for it. 

### The functions it implemented
__1. Pet info preview__

  &emsp;&emsp;The main interface and the beginning of APP. Every item in this interface shows a picture and some simple info of pet.

__2. Detailed info show__

  &emsp;&emsp;Jump from the item of main interface. Shows the detailed info of pet.

__3. Deliver pet info__

  &emsp;&emsp;Release the info about pets. You can upload picture from your local phoot album but not video and audio.

__4. Community communication__

  &emsp;&emsp;There is a interface used for chatting.
